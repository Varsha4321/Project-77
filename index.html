    <h1>Project on console</h1>
    <p>Visual Studio is a software that allows creators and others build websites and code what ever they desire. You can set it up by downloading and installing it, createing a new file, and begin coding!</p>
    <p>The console screen is a pop-up screen that allows others to "print" things on. It can also be used for debugging.
        You can open it by right clicking and clicking inspect. To print something on the console here are the steps.
        Go to your html code, open "script tag", write "console.log()" and pass whatever you want in the curved brackets.</p>
        <script>
            console.log("My first console project!")
           var first_name = "Varsha ";
           var last_name = "Mothe";
           console.log(first_name);
           console.log(last_name);
           var full_name = first_name.concat(last_name);
           console.log(full_name)
           var num_1 = "2";
           var num_2 = "5";
           var addition = 2 + 5;
           var subtraction = 2 - 5;
           var multiplication = 2 * 5;
           var division = 2/5;
           console.log(addition);
           console.log(subtraction);
           console.log(multiplication);
           console.log(division);
